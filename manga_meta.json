When the seeds of trouble sown in the hearts of good citizens blossom, bizarre incidents will happen... \"Six Consciousnesses Thought Changing Ataraxia\" marked Kago's third version of the concept of a girl entering a cyberspace-like psychic realm wherein she can \"hack\" people.  He first utilized it in \"Soul Diver Saga: Nirvana\" (1992), only three chapters of which were published before the magazine serializing it (Bandai's Cyber Comix) stopped publication. In 1995, Kago published a much less sexually explicit one-shot simply titled \"ataraxia\" in Young Jump (later collected in \"Hannya Haramita\") before this expanded and much kinkier version followed in 2000/2001. Additionally, various characters from this manga appear in other stories by Kago, some of them collected in \"Super-Dimensional Love Gun\".", "edefb2df-dd28-4f66-a660-7185ef6c4f05": "The genius top student played games in an attempt to flirt with girls, but was struck by lightning on a rainy day and transported into the world of the game?!
